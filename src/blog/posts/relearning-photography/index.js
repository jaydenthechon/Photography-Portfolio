        I've been working with Gregory Marinovich to improve my photography. As of late I feel like 
        my skills as a photographer have hit a plateau. I realize that in the last 10 years I've been 
        taking photos I've been hyper focused on ensuring tack sharp focus, optimal composition, and 
        pleasing colors. I've been too focused on big bokeh balls and deleting photos if I missed 
        focus by 2mm. Perfectly straight horizons is a must. So yeah they look good as wallpapers.

        But when is the last time you've really taken a 2nd look at wallpapers?

        Who actually cares about perfect focus? Well I suppose portrait and product photography, but 
        that's not what I do (for fun anyways, I still for portraiture for work)

        This account is something different, it's a place to showcase all my work where everything I 
        do is against the things I've learned and practiced over the last 10 years. Expect out of focus 
        shots, compositional horrors, high contrast, noise, and angles that would have trig professors 
        running in terror. But through those mistakes I am striving to work on mastering the use of 
        light; instead of light being a background object, I will make it the main focus of my 
        photography. Instead of going for tack sharp photos, I will focus on what I want to convey 
        whether it's the mood I felt taking the photo or the light I saw or the story that took place 
        before, during, and after the shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        A whole new era of photography for me.
