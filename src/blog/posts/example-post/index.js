      <h2>Why I Started Photography</h2>
      <p>
        Photography has always been more than just a hobby for me. It's a way to capture 
        moments, tell stories, and preserve memories that would otherwise be lost to time. 
        I picked up my first camera 9 years ago, and I haven't looked back since.
